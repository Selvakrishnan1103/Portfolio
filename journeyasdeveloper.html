        <h1>My Journey as a Developer: From Biology to Bytes</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
        <p>Hello, tech enthusiasts! Welcome to my blog, where I share my journey from being a biology student to a budding developer. This path has been filled with incredible learning experiences, challenges, and moments of sheer joy. Here's my story.</p><br>

        <h2>From Biology to Engineering</h2><br>

        <h3>The Shift</h3><br>
        <p>I began my academic journey in the field of biology during my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) education. Little did I know that my path would soon take a dramatic turn. After completing my HSC, I secured a seat at PET Engineering College. It was a new world for me, transitioning from the life sciences to the realm of computer science and engineering.</p><br>

        <h3>The Spark</h3><br>
        <p>In my first semester, I encountered the programming language Python. My Python teacher played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of programming. Her guidance and support ignited my passion for solving various problems through code.</p>

        <h2>Diving into Programming</h2><br>

        <h3>Learning New Languages</h3><br>
        <p><strong>Second Semester:</strong> I was introduced to C programming, which laid the foundation for understanding low-level programming concepts.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Third Semester:</strong> I delved into Java, taught by my Python teacher, and data structures, taught by Mrs. Mary Nisha, further expanding my programming knowledge.</p><br>

        <h3>Online Internship Experience</h3><br>
        <p>While many of my classmates pursued internships, I opted for an online course through the Naan Mudhalvan scheme, a Tamil Nadu government initiative to upskill college students. This experience introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, setting the stage for future projects. A big thanks to our Chief Minister, Mr. M. K. Stalin, and the officers involved in this initiative!</p><br>

        <h2>Building Projects</h2><br>

        <h3>The GPA Calculator</h3><br>
        <p>In the fourth semester, I learned about algorithms and DBMS, gaining basic knowledge of MySQL. I created a simple Java program for a GPA calculator, using online compilers like OnlineGDB and Programiz. It was a straightforward program that provided output on the screen based on text input.</p>

        <h3>Transforming the Calculator</h3><br>
        <p>In the fifth semester, I got my own laptop, which fueled my curiosity to explore and create new applications. I decided to make my GPA calculator more attractive and interactive. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a GPA calculator webpage. Realizing the need to share it with my colleagues, I used Android Studio to convert it into an app. The positive feedback from my teachers and friends motivated me to pursue more innovative projects.</p><br>

        <h2>The Student Information System</h2><br>

        <h3>Mini Project</h3><br>
        <p>During the sixth semester, we were tasked with a mini project. I decided to develop a Student Information System (SIS) using Python Flask. With no prior knowledge of Flask, I turned to YouTube and online resources to learn the basics. I implemented the core concepts and connected the system to a MySQL database, successfully completing the SIS project by the end of the semester.</p><br>

        <h2>Fun with Bingo</h2><br>

        <h3>Game Development</h3><br>
        <p>One day, while playing Bingo with friends, I had an idea: why not create a digital version of this game? I started building a Bingo game, which is currently in development. This project has been a fun and engaging way to apply my skills and creativity.</p><br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2><br>

        <h3>Reflecting on the Journey</h3><br>
        <p>From a biology student to a developer, my journey has been a blend of learning, experimentation, and growth. Each step has taught me valuable lessons and opened new horizons. I look forward to sharing more of my experiences and projects with you in future blog posts.</p><br>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

        <p>Thank you for reading! Stay tuned for more insights and stories from my development journey.</p>
